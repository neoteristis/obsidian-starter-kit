## Setup

Using community plugins can in theory be dangerous so Obsidian is taking no risks and asks you for an authorization to access the marketplace.

From now on you can install any plugins your heart desires by clicking on "Browse". Keep in mind that after installing a plugin must enable it by ticking it.

## Plugin Configuration

Most, if not all plugins, provide an interface where you can play around with the parameters and customize the plugin to your preferences. All of those configurations are stored in `.obsidian/plugins/plugin-name/` in `.json` format most of the time.
