# Obsidian Starter Kit
---
## Introduction

This repository has been made with the purpose of sharing with you my way of using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I'd like to emphasize that Obsidian allows for extensive customization, thus making each system very personal. I am sure that you will, at some point or another, change things here and there to make it your way. And it's great if you do so ! Feel free to contribute to this repository:-)

I've been using Obsidian for nearly a full year now and have used it for different purposes, ranging from taking notes in class, taking meeting or conference notes, managing to do lists, writing essays, and finally saving stuff I'd like to be able to read later. At time of writing, I have about 450 notes in my vault.

We will go over all the customization I've done, all plugins I use, how I organize my notes as well as some tips and tricks ! This content can be found in [[Utils README|Utils]]. The first page I'd encourage you to read is [[Obsidian Interface|how to use Obsidian interface]].

Important : **This repository is currently in a WIP state, meaning that some content is missing.**

## What is Obsidian ?

You will find hundreds of video on YouTube explaining how to use Obsidian, what plugins to install and which workflows to follow. Depending on the time you have on your hand, you can explore those but if you only have one video to watch, I'd encourage you to take a look at this one : [Hack your brain with Obsidian.md](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk&t=623s).

## Vault Organization

Here is the tree structure of my vault:

```
|-- .git
|-- .gitignore
|-- .obsidian
|-- Attachments
|-- Company
|-- Daily Notes
|-- Inbox
|-- Knowledge
|-- Personal
|-- School
|-- Projects
`-- Utils
```

We will go over each of those to understand their purpose but you can find detailed explanation in the README of each directory. 
- `.git`: GIT configuration directory
- `.gitignore`: file to ignore elements of your vault from GIT versioning
- `.obsidian`: core directory of any obsidian vault, used to store configurations
- [[Attachments/README|Attachments]]: stores by default all images and documents imported in the Vault and that are not Markdown
- [[Company README|Company README]]: used for content related to your job
- [[Daily Notes README|Daily Notes README]]: pretty obvious, stores all the daily notes 
- [[Inbox README|Inbox]]: default directory for all the notes created without specifying the target directory
- [[Knowledge README|Knowledge]]: contains everything learned via any means and that could be used outside of work
- [[Personal README|Personal]]: stuff that only refers to you
- [[Projects README|Projects]]: contains the notes for your big projects in a very organized way (WIP)
- [[School README|School]]: used for content related to your courses
- [[Utils README|Utils]]: everything that might help you or that you might need later on
